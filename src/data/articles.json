Regardless of the diet you follow, if you want to lose weight, you must be in a caloric deficit. It is a simple equation: calories in vs. calories out. To achieve a caloric deficit, you can either eat less, increase your physical activity, or a combination of both."

Popular methods include the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window) and the 5:2 diet (eating normally for 5 days and restricting calories for 2 days). The theory is that it helps you consume fewer calories overall and can improve metabolic health."
